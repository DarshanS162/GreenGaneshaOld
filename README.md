This project entails the development of an E-Commerce application using the Spring Boot framework, specifically designed to facilitate the seamless purchase
of a diverse range of Ganpati idols. Users will have the capability to engage in various interactions related to the products, including exploring products, 
searching by category, filtering by price range, add items to their shopping cart. The application enables users to view and manage their cart items, adjust quantities,
and remove items. Furthermore, users can seamlessly place orders and retrieve detailed order information.
